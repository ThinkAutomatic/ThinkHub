# ThinkHub
This serves as a local area network proxy for lightweight IoT devices that do not have direct ssl enabled connectivity to the Internet such as Particle devices using the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkAutomatic/ThinkParticle" target="_blank">ThinkParticle</a> library.

## Installation 
```
npm install thinkhub
```
Then run it.
```
node .
```
This module uses the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkAutomatic/thinkdevice" target="_blank">thinkdevice</a> library module which has instructions for associating devices such as the ThinkHub to a Think Automatic account which needs to be done before other devices can communicate through it.
